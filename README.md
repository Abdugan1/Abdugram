# Abdugram
<p>Abdugram is client/server TCP based little messenger.</p>
<p></p>My first project with network.</p>

![Abdugram main page](/screenshots/main_page.png)

## Info
<p>Server is console application. I used "<b>ncurses</b>" library to make simple ui.</p>
<p>To install ncurses library just type</p>

```
sudo apt-get install libncursesw5-dev
```

<p>UI was written by using Qt Widgets. No stylesheet was used. You can check some screenshots [here](/screenshots/).</p>
